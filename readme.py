# rfsoapyfile

A Python 3 script for capturing and recording a SDR stream to a WAV file (or serving it to a HTTP audio stream).
The script is threaded for high performance, especially
on a Raspberry Pi.  The script includes a REST API
for controlling the capture and WAV recording remotely.

The script will save the stream in either RF64 or WAV file format.
By default the recording uses the WAV format.  The SDR specific 'auxi' 
metadata chunk is added to the file as well.

## Dependencies

The script requires the numpy and SoapySDR Python libraries.

## Example

```
$ python soapyfile.py -f 100.1e6 -r 1e6 --pcm16 -g 42 --output out --pause
```

## Usage

{ run("soapyfile.py --help") }

## REST API

The REST API is available off port 8080.  Use POST or PUT to change
a program or radio setting.  Use GET to view it.  If a boolean is needed, the following
strings are accepted: y, n, yes, no, true, and false.

```
PUT /quit              <bool>      stop recording and terminate program, yes or no
PUT /rate              <float>     set sampling rate (Hz) but only if recording is paused
PUT /frequency         <float>     set center frequency (Hz)
PUT /gain              <float>     set gain (dB)
PUT /agc               <bool>      enable agc, yes or no
PUT /pause             <bool>      pause recording, yes or no
PUT /setting/<name>    <string>    change named soapy setting

GET /rate              return sampling rate (Hz)
GET /frequency         return center frequency (Hz)
GET /gain              return gain (Hz)
GET /agc               return AGC setting (yes or no)
GET /pause             return whether the recording is paused (yes or no)
GET /setting           return list of available soapy setting names
GET /setting/<name>    return value of named soapy setting

GET /s16               return 16-bit integer PCM WAV HTTP audio stream
GET /f32               return 32-bit floating point PCM WAV HTTP audio stream
```
